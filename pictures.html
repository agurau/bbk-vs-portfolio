            <h2>Carpe Diem</h2>
            <p>
              The first image was edited with various types of brushes, colours
              and sizes. I have also used the clone tool to remove unwanted
              items and I added a flower, which was previously selected with the
              pen tool. I added some random designs in the background. However,
              I wanted to add a crown to imitate Jean-Michel Basquiat paintings
              and a positive message such as 'Carpe Diem'. Fully edited with
              Photoshop.

            <h2>Forest</h2>
            <p>
              For the second image, I have used two pictures. First, I have
              selected the model using the pen brush. After, I created an
              adjustment layer with solid color and I moved the model layer on
              top. In addition, I dragged the second image and I selected screen
              blending mode. I added a black and white adjustment and selected
              high contrast blue filter preset. I moved the trees until I was
              happy with the result. I also hid the head of the model adding a
              level adjustment layer. To conclude, I selected the brush tool and
              removed the trees from the back of the model and her ear. Fully
              edited with Photoshop.

            <h2>Giraffe</h2>
            <p>
              This image was one of my first experiments with Photoshop as I was
              getting familiar with the pen selection tool. I used various
              images and brought them all together in the same picture using
              different layers. I also used the clone tool to replicate the
              white vase for the flowers. Fully edited with Photoshop.

            <h2>Walking</h2>
            <p>
              I brought two images to Photoshop and I selected the shape of the
              girl's body with the pen tool. I blended the colors of both images
              and I blurried the background a bit in comparison with the girl.
              The first edit had some shapes from the previous image, hence I
              had to delete the unwanted items. Fully edited with Photoshop.
